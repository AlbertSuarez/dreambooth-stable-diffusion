# Dreambooth with Stable diffusion

ðŸ–¼ Dreambooth example using my photos based on the [dotCSV video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgKBjRLvjLs).

## Usage

1. Generate a dataset like the one found in `data/input` with around 20 images with the following typology:
    ```text
    60% of foreground images of you
    30% of half body images of you
    10% of full body images of you
    ```

2. Access the [Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-HIbslQd7Ei_mAt25ipqSUMvbe3POm98?usp=sharing) and follow the instructions for training your model (you can find a copy under [`docs/fast_dreambooth__dotCSV__version.ipynb`](docs/fast_dreambooth__dotCSV__version.ipynb) file).
