# Dreambooth with Stable diffusion

ðŸ–¼ Dreambooth example using my photos based on the [dotCSV video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgKBjRLvjLs).

## Usage

1. Generate a dataset like the one found in `data/input` with around 20 images with the following typology (this dataset must contain square images of `512x512` pixels):
    ```text
    60% of foreground images of you
    30% of half body images of you
    10% of full body images of you
    ```

2. Access the [Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-HIbslQd7Ei_mAt25ipqSUMvbe3POm98?usp=sharing) and follow the instructions for training your model (you can find a copy under [`docs/fast_dreambooth__dotCSV__version.ipynb`](docs/fast_dreambooth__dotCSV__version.ipynb) file).

3. Once the model is trained, download the generated weights from your Google Drive since you will use them locally.

4. Using the amazing UI that [AbdBarho](https://github.com/AbdBarho) put together [here](https://github.com/AbdBarho/stable-diffusion-webui-docker), you can run the model locally and generate your own images.
   
   4.1. Clone the repo.
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:AbdBarho/stable-diffusion-webui-docker.git
   ```
   
   4.2. Download all needed dependencies:
   ```bash
   docker compose --profile download up --build
   ```
   
   4.3. Copy your weights under the `data` folder along with the rest of models. 

   4.4. Run the UI:
   ```bash
   docker compose --profile hlky up -d --build
   ```

   4.5. Will start the app on [`http://localhost:7860/`](http://localhost:7860/).

5. Enjoy! ðŸŽ‰
